# QuickBite-Crisis-Recovery-Business-Performance-Dashboard
## Problem Statement
QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup (founded in 2020) that connects customers with nearby restaurants and cloud kitchens.
In June 2025, QuickBite faced a major crisis. A viral social media incident involving food safety violations at partner restaurants, combined with a week-long delivery outage during the monsoon season, triggered massive customer backlash. Competitors capitalized with aggressive campaigns, worsening the situation.
 

# The challenges were severe: 

A large portion of active users disengaged within a short period. 

Daily orders saw a sharp decline compared to earlier months. 

Customer satisfaction scores fell sharply, signaling trust issues. 

Many partner restaurants shifted to competing platforms. 

Customer acquisition costs rose significantly. 

QuickBite has allocated a major recovery budget, overhauled food safety protocols, and upgraded its delivery infrastructure.
 

# The management expects detailed insights into the following: 

Customer Segments: Identify which customers can be recovered and which need new strategies. 

Order Patterns: Analyse order trends to uncover behavioral changes across phases (pre-crisis, crisis, recovery). 

Delivery Performance: Assess delivery times, cancellations, and SLA compliance to pinpoint operational gaps. 

Campaign Opportunities: Recommend targeted initiatives to rebuild trust and loyalty across demographics. 

Restaurant Partnerships: Predict which partnerships are most valuable for long-term retention. 

Feedback & Sentiment: Monitor real-time ratings, reviews, and sentiment to guide ongoing recovery efforts.
